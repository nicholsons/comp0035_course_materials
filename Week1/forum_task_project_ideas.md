#### Instructions
Read the activity related to choosing a project idea before you post here.  

1. Use the '**Add a new question**' button below to post at least one idea for a project. 
 
   Think about:

   - what is the topic/subject area?
   - what questions would you like to address?
   - which dataset are you thinking of using (provide URL)? If you haven't identified a data set, briefly describe what data you would ideally like to be able to find.

   An alternative approach might be to find an interesting data set and then think about what questions you could answer using it.

   There are a couple of example posts below to help you think about what to write.

2. Give feedback to others

   Once you have posted your idea, review the ideas that others have submitted. Ideally give feedback to at least 2 other people.  

   You should receive feedback on your idea.

#### Example posts
1. Example based on an area of subject interest

   "I am a biomedical engineer. I'm interested in how the recent coronavirus has affected product innovations for the diagnosis and treatment of covid. 

   I'm considering questions such as:
   - how has the research activity in this area changed?
   - what has been the impact on open source publication of product designs/specifications?

   I haven't found a dataset yet but am going to look for data about how the funding for grants may have changed, the number of scientific papers being published. I was thinking of trying to find out historically the balance of patent versus open source product designs and the number of new product ideas that have been provided where the design is open source like the UCL/Mercedes Formula 1 breathing device."

2. Example based on an interesting data set

   **Note**: This example is based on (copied from!) the work that one of the students on this course completed in another module. This comment is by way of acknowledging my plagiarism of that students' work.

   "I found some interesting data about GCSE performance in different London boroughs and another data set on income in each borough on the London Data Store. I'm going to try and look at the statistics for each borough and analyse the data to determine whether the there is a correlation between academic attainment with income levels specific to each borough."
