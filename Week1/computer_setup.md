# Task instructions
A full list of the software, tools and code libraries used in the course is provided in the 'Additional resources' section of Moodle.

For this task you need to establish a method to use the following resources:

1. Python 3.5 (or later)
2. A way to edit Python, SQL, CSS, HTML and JavaScript code
3. GitHub

Most students will prefer to install software to use on their own computer. However, you may be in a position where this is not possible.   
As far as is possible, online alternatives to using your own computer have been indicated.  
If you do not have access to a computer on which you can install software, and have difficulty in completing any of the course using the online alternatives suggested, then please email me, <sarah.sanders@ucl.ac.uk> (course tutor), so that I am aware of your constraint.

## 1. Python
If you are using your own computer and developing files locally (i.e. not using an online code editor) then you will need to install [Python 3.5 (or newer)](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
If you are using an online code editors only then skip to section 2.1.

## 2. Code editor
You will need a way to edit Python, Flask (python, Jinja2), SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.  
The most powerful way to edit code is to use an integrated development environment (IDE). IDEs features that go beyond simple code writing to make a developer's life easier. However, they do take some time to learn how to use, and if you are installing on your own computer they can require a significant amount of disk space.
There are many IDEs that are freely available to students and can be downloaded and installed. The following are some of the most popular for Python.

- PyCharm Professional ([apply for free student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students))
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (free)
- [Atom](https://atom.io) (free)

If you already have a preferred IDE or editor that supports Python, Flask (python, Jinja2), SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript then feel free to continue using it.

**The course tutor will use PyCharm Professional in class and video materials.**

### 2.1 Online code editors

**TODO**: This section can be modified substantially if funding for Codio is achieved. In that case Codio should be used if students want to work online.

There are a number of online code editors that you may be able to use. You may need to use different editors for different activities.

- [Codeshare](https://codeshare.io) Free, supports all languages  
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io) Free but only supports HTML, CSS & JavaScript (not Flask)  
- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/) Requires an Azure subscription, however they ofer $100 credit for students  
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/pricing/) 50 hours a month free

You may also be able to complete some activities using a Jupyter notebook environment linked to your GitHub repository such as:  

- [Binder](https://mybinder.org) Free, no account required, no ability to save files within the Binder service, instead you would need to commit and push changes to GitHub.
- [AzureNotebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com) Free, account required to save files.

## 3. Source code control (using Git and GitHub)
This provides a way for you to store your code, share it with others and track changes made. While there are alternative source code control systems, you need to use GitHub for this course. GitHub is an online service for managing code that uses the Git version control software.
You should follow 3.1 if you are using online tools only.
### 3.1 GitHub (all students)
[Create a student account using your *UCL student ID*](https://education.github.com/pack). It is important that you do this as the coursework relies on your use of a UCL account.
### 3.2 Git (if you are editing code using software installed on your computer)
If you are developing on your own computer you will also need to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This is the underlying source code control software that GitHub uses.
### 3.3. Local Git software (optional if you are using a editor or IDE that doesn't have Git support)
If you are using an IDE such as PyCharm then you will work with GitHub from within the IDE. In this case you should not need to install a local Git client. However, if you are using a code editor or IDE that does not provide integration with GitHub then you may want to download and install the [GitHub Desktop software](https://desktop.github.com). 

You can work with GitHub directly from a Git command prompt without using desktop software. However, unless you feel comfortable with using command line environments then this method isn't generally recommended for those just starting to learn Git and GitHub.
