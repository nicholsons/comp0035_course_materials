### 1 Introduction
This document specifies the content, peer marking process and submission for the group coursework. The group coursework is 60% of the overall module assessment.  

Working in groups, you are tasked with specifying, analysing, and proposing a design for an application that could be developed using web technologies and accessed using any device that supports the use of a web browser.  

The scope and nature of the application will be different for each group based on an initial concept that you will be allocated during the group formation process.

### 2 Group formation
You will work in groups of &lt;group size TBC and depends on the number of PGTA and students registering for the course&gt;.

You have some choice of which group you join, however where there are students who have not joined a group then they may be allocated by the course tutor to any group not already at the maximum group size.  

Use the group selection task on Moodle to join a group. There will be a deadline for this task which is typically in the first week of term.  

### 3 Selecting a project topic
You will decide on a project topic in your group. There is a task on Moodle to complete this. There is also an assessment task on Moodle to submit your project idea and the associated data.

Whichever topic you decide on, it must allow you to demonstrate the baseline requirements.

#### 3.1 Baseline requirements for all projects
You will design a web application (app) that addresses a data science problem or need for a particular community of users.

The app that you design must meet the following requirements, so your project must allow for this:

1. The app is launched/run using the Flask framework
2. The web app has a responsive design (that is, it adapts for appropriate viewing on different devices such as a mobile phone or a laptop)
3. The app collects data (e.g. using web forms) and stores that data in a database 
    - this could be satisfied by requiring the users of your application to create an account, create and maintain a profile, and logon to use the application.
    - or, you may develop an application that extends the current dataset by gathering data from the users of the app that adds to the data that is analysed
4. The app generates pages that contain content from the data in the database.
5. The app provides visual representations of data (data visualisation)
    1. visual representations from data that do not allow for user interaction
    2. visual representations from data for which there is some user interaction, i.e. what is presented is in some way dynamically altered by the user.   
The data that you use in the visualisations and to make predictions does not have to be stored in a database. You may access 3rd party data provided by and API, or another format such as spreadsheet.
6. Allow members of the community to communicate with each other in some way. There are many ways you could do this, for example (but not limited to): 
   - post comments on the data analysis and charts on the app
   - contribute to forums related to the topic of the web app (create posts, reply to other people's posts)
   - create blog articles
   - create and edit a wiki
   - chat room
   - messaging facility

You can include any other requirements that you believe would be needed to make the app useful for your chosen user community. It does not matter if you design additional features in this project that you do not implement in COMP0034!

### 4 Carrying out the project
During the project you will create a set of software engineering deliverables (e.g. diagrams, documents) that together form a proposal to a client for a data science web application.  

The deliverables align to topics taught in the course. While you submit the deliverables as a single submission at the end of the course, you are expected to work on the individual deliverables each week throughout the course.  

You will meet weekly with an assigned PGTA and during this meeting you will review your team's progress and get feedback on drafts of your work. 

You will be allocated a meeting time. The format of the meetings will depend on how the course is being delivered:

- **Face to face** meetings will be held in the allocated tutorial rooms (see timetable for details).  
- **Remote** meetings will be held using Teams.  

The PGTAs cannot accommodate late starting meetings as they have to meet with subsequent groups. So, if you start your meeting late, then your overall meeting time will be reduced.  

Treat the PGTA as you would a real-world client, e.g. prepare for the meeting, give them updates, present your work to them.  

The PGTA is not a specialist in the problem domain however so do not expect them to give you requirements, this is the key area in which they differ from a real world client. They do however have software engineering expertise and will offer formative feedback on your requirements and other deliverables and give guidance on software engineering processes.  

The PGTA will not be marking your work and may not be familiar with the grading criteria so do not ask them for grading advice or specific details relating to the coursework criteria. Please refer this type of question to the course tutor, Sarah Sanders using the Moodle forum. 

### 5 Creating the coursework deliverables
The final coursework should be a proposal for a project to design and implement a web application that provides a solution to a given problem (or opportunity).  

#### 5.1 Audience and purpose
The audience for your proposal is the IT manager, Data scientist and Product manager of your client organisation.  
Your audience will understand appropriate data science and software engineering terminology and any business terms that relate to the nature of the client's work.  
As well as assessing the individual deliverables, marking will consider how well the overall proposal is argued and presented. Clarity and conciseness matter. More value is placed on clarity and conciseness rather than length and verbosity.  

#### 5.2 Format of the proposal
You can choose any of the following formats to create the proposal for your group coursework:

- Presentation with embedded content (or with deliverables in an accompanying zip file) 
- Video (with deliverables in  zip file)
- Moodle MyPortfolio
- Flask web app
- GitHub repository with the proposal in markdown (e.g. a README with links to the deliverables) - you can export a GitHub repo to zip.
- Report (examples include a single document with each deliverable as a chapter; an multimedia report using the Sway tool in Office365; etc)

Marking is based on criteria, and so long as you meet the criteria, it does not matter which format you choose. The assessment has been designed to offer flexibility to allow students to choose a method that best suits their needs, interests, learning goals and circumstances.  

You will not want to cover the detail of each deliverable in your proposal e.g. you would not discuss every individual requirement when recording a video. Highlight the key aspects in your proposal and then include the full deliverable in the final Moodle submission.

The final output should be zipped to a single file and uploaded to Moodle. 
Moodle supports files up to 160MB. Video files should be added to Media Central or YouTube and the URL included in the Moodle submission.

#### 5.3 What to include  
Whichever format you choose, your proposal must contain the following software engineering deliverables (in any order) . 

1. Introduction
    - problem (or opportunity) statement
2. Analysis 
    - requirements, user stories and/or use cases 
3. Design 
    - application design e.g. UML class diagram
    - interface design (wireframes)
    - data e.g. what data is needed for the project, what format the data is provided in, where you got the data (source), if there are any gaps or issues with the data, etc
    - database design
4. Implementation 
    - implementation approach e.g. what process(es) do you intend to use to manage the project such as Scrum, CRISP-DM etc
    - testing i.e. how do you plan to test the app? what types of testing will you carry out?
5. ‘Who did What’
    - A list or table stating the names of each group member and what that person contributed or worked on.

You may optionally include any other software engineering deliverables that you think are useful for your proposal. 

When including any deliverable, make sure that you explain what it is and why it is important and included in the proposal.

Appropriate formats for each deliverable will be discussed in the relevant weeks of the course.  You may choose any appropriate tools to create these, so long the final output can be included in a format that can be uploaded to Moodle and read by the marker (see list below).

#### 5.4 Supported file formats
File formats that can be marked are:

- Office products available in the UCL office365 suite e.g. Sway, Powerpoint, Word
- .PDF
- .md (markdown)
- Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL (for Flask app submissions)
- image formats (.png, .jpg)

**Do not** submit files that require bespoke software to access them, or those that require Mac products such as Pages or Keynote.

### 6 Submission
Submit a single file on Moodle (e.g. zip all contents). One submission per group. 
Re-submission before the deadline is possible, with any previous version being overwritten. The last submitted version will be the one marked after the deadline has passed. 

#### 6.1 Late Submission
Late submission penalties will apply (refer to your student handbook for details) and are applied by the departmental administrators (not the course tutor). Marks that are entered in the Moodle gradebook will be the mark before any penalty is applied. Penalties will only be applied once the marks are in Portico. Please remember this when you are reviewing your marks.

### 7 Marking
An individual’s mark for the group project is calculated as **Group Mark * IPAC score**. 

#### 7.1 Group mark
The **group mark** will be determined in accordance with the [marking criteria for computer science coursework](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/2901587/mod_resource/content/3/Grade%20Descriptors%20Table%20CS%20v9%20-%20NM.pdf).  Note in particular the requirements for achieving marks over 70.  

Further, the following gives guidance specific to this assignment:

   < Marking criteria TBC >

#### 7.2 IPAC Peer assessment score
The mark that an individual receives for the group project is calculated considering the relative contribution of each person to the group. A UCL-wide tool called the [IPAC (Individual Peer Assessed Contribution)]() is used to determine individual contribution.

The **IPAC score** is determined from the results of a questionnaire. The questionnaire is completed by each team member for all members of the team. It must be completed at two points during the project: 

1.	At mid-way just before reading week (date on Moodle) – this will give you formative feedback from your peers. Anyone receiving a score of less than 0.4 (40%) will be investigated to identify any issues.
2.	At the end of the project when you submit the final report (date on Moodle). This will be used to calculate your final mark. Anyone receiving a score of 0.4 (40%) or less will receive 0 and will be required to complete the late summer assessment.

Each member of the group must complete the IPAC questionnaire on Moodle at both points.

The questionnaire asks you to rate each team member according to the following criteria:

| Criterion	| Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Attendance	| Attending scheduled tutorial sessions, meetings with the TA and other meetings arranged outside of these (online or face to face) |
| Effort | The student’s attitude to work in and out of the class, reflects their attentiveness and contribution to discussion and work load |
| Quality of work | A reflection of how complete, accurate and informative the work the student produced was |
| Teamwork | Demonstrates a cooperative and supportive attitude |

Each criterion is marked using the following:

| Mark | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Poor | Student did not achieve this criteria point at all |
| Unsatisfactory | Student needed encouragement and was often unwilling |
| Satisfactory | Student completed what was expected of them but nothing more |
| Good | Student did slightly more than expected and was a benefit to the group |
| Excellent | Student went above and beyond for this project and was essential to the team |
