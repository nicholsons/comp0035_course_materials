# Module assessment: participation
This module requires a 70% participation rate (in line with the departmental policy requiring 70% attendance). The participation rate will be tracked electronically by Moodle using the </span><i style="font-size: 1rem;">Activity Completion</i><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> feature.  

You will see dotted and solid checkboxes next to activities that are used for participation tracking:  

- **Dotted box (empty)**: Moodle will automatically indicate completion when activity criteria have been met. Example criteria: Student creates 1 new discussion and posts 2 replies in a forum.   
- **Dotted box (checked)**: Indicates that the activity criteria have been met and participation is tracked.  
- **Solid box (empty)**: Moodle cannot detect activity completion automatically. You must click on the box manually to indicate that you completed the activity.  
- **Solid box (checked)**: You indicated manually that you completed this activity. Note: During marking, we may use other data such as access logs and manual sighting of contributions to cross-check whether an activity has been completed properly.

The checkboxes are also a useful mechanism to track your own progress in this module. You should be able to see a summary of your progress in the blocks on the right hand side of the Moodle screen.  

During the final marking period, we will assess the activity completion data to confirm that you meet the minimum participation requirement. At least 70% of the required activities must be complete to pass this module.  

You are generally expected to complete activities during the allotted weekly period. This is necessary to manage the pace of the cohort. We recognise that external circumstances may occasionally get in the way, so activity deadlines are not rigorously enforced, with the exception of the final submissions as well as activities related to coursework and scheduling.
