You are working on a group project in which you need to investigate and specify a data science focused web application for a particular community of users. You must choose the data set and the community you are developing the application for.

Two groups cannot work on the same concept so the last step of this activity is for you to write a problem statement related to your suggested data set and user community on Moodle. You will receive feedback on this from the course tutor.

#### Step 1: Read the [baseline requirements in the group coursework specification](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1908177)     
This will give you an understanding of the type of features you will need to design for the app.  

#### Step 2: Choose a data set
As your first data science project, it is recommended that you consider problems that have limited data and variables, otherwise your project may get too complex too quickly. Look for something that has a limited data set. 
You are likely to have to clean and manipulate the data which may be tedious and time consuming, another reason why it is useful to have a topic that you are interested in and motivates you to keep going!

You should already have some ideas for interesting data sets that you can discuss in your group (everyone in the group should have suggested at least one interesting data set in activity **1.X**. If not then the following may give you some ideas.

##### 2.1 Projects related to your main degree discipline
Is there an aspect of your degree subject for which there is a data set that could be explored? 
There may be researchers in your department that you could speak to, or you may have come across something in your studies or work experience that interests you (make sure you have the rights to use any data though). 
Maybe you are working on (or have worked on) a lab experiment or project that involved collecting and analysing data?

##### 2.2 Recommender applications
Could you focus on helping people to make an informed choice, or giving them recommendations?
Recommender apps filter content in some way to predict what a user would be interested in. They make recommendations using sources such as a user’s preferences that they’ve shared or previous transactions; or looking at the preferences of people in your network, or those of people with similar demographics.
Online services such as NetFlix, Amazon Spotify and  make extensive use of these type of applications.

##### 2.3 Projects related to public services
Public health, education, employment, crime etc are all areas where there are plenty of published and high quality data sets. Have a look at the [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk).  
You could build a dashboard, or interactive report, to help communicate an idea or topic. There are plenty of examples and tutorials showing how to build interactive Covid-19 dashboards, while you clearly must not copy one of these for your project (plagiarism), looking at a few may give you some inspiration for your own project. 

##### 2.4 Artistic and creative visualisation
Rather than focusing on analysing the data, could you instead use data to create art?
