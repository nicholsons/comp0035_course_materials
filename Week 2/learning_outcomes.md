This week focuses on introducing you to the processes used in software engineering and data science. You will also focus on joining a project group and deciding on a topic for your project. 

### Learning outcomes
After completing all of the materials and activities in week 2 you should:

- Know the common methods used for managing data science and software engineering projects.
- Be able to select a method for a given situation.
- Understand the importance and use of source code control.
- Have created a repository in GitHub and know how to make changes to code and work with branches. This contributes to your individual and group coursework.
- Have selected a project group and discussed you initial ideas for a project with your group. This contributes to your individual and group coursework.
- Have investigated data science and software engineering processes and made a recommendation for your project. This contributes to your individual coursework.

### Materials and activities
Required material and activities are numbered to indicate the order in which you should ideally progress through them. A recommended (but approximate) amount of time to spend on each is also indicated in the title of each.
