Hello, I’m Sarah Sanders and I will be your tutor for this module, COMP0035 Applied Software Engineering. This video is intended as a chance for you to find out a bit about me as the tutor. 
Firstly, I hope that this finds you and your families well. It has certainly been an unusual year so far and this term will be quite different to your previous years of study. As you know, courses are being delivered remotely as far as is possible and this module is no exception. Given then many of you may not have been able to return to London yet then we are also going to deliver the course without any scheduled ‘synchronous’ activities.
Personally, I will be mostly working from my home office, that is a somewhat grand term as it is really my garage converted into a sort of usable room! I also wanted to explain that despite my grey hairs I am mum to young children, 4 year old twins who have just started primary school. I’m telling you this because I work part-time around school hours, so I would ask you to remember that when contacting me as depending on the time of day I may not see your email or message until the following working day. In particular any messages you send in the evening or weekend’s won’t get an immediate response. 
In terms of contacting me, given how many of you are taking the course, please try and stick to using Moodle or the Teams group as far as you can. It makes it much easier for me to reply to and keep track of, and also means that should I be absent for any reason that another tutor could also  see any communication.
Given my advanced years students often assume that I am a Professor. Just to be up front, I am not a professor and I don’t undertake research. My role is to teach and I focus on introductory programming and software engineering. My background is in industry. I graduated with a degree in business studies and an MBA and completed the graduate programme at IBM South Bank in London in the early 90s. I went on to work in IT consulting for a few years before spending almost a decade at the Financial Times. My experience is all related to software development projects and programmes, most of which were online related. I’ve managed project managers, business analysts and software developers and have a wide range of experience in software and systems engineering. I was often involved in training activities and 10 years ago decided to change career into education. I love teaching and am really passionate about helping people to learn computing, particularly at a novice level where it is too easy for people to be discouraged.
I haven’t taught online or remotely before, just as many of you may not have studied remotely before. This is a learning experience for us all and I would really welcome any feedback as we go through the course, especially if there are things that could be improved to help you while the course is still going (please don’t wait till it’s too late).
We also have a great team of PGTAs for this module, I encourage you to check out their welcome videos too.

The last topic I wanted to cover now is a quick overview of how to use this Moodle site. The learning activities are structured into weekly activities (10 teaching weeks plus reading wee). The course has been designed such that you spend 150 learning hours on the module, and this effort will be spread as evenly as possible throughout the 11 weeks. When you go to the Moodle site you should see a section for each week, they are numbered 1 to 10 with a week for reading week between week’s 5 and 6. In each week there are a series of activities that are numbered. The idea is that you work through them in order, though there is nothing to stop you completing them in any order you like. One important point to note though is that just like with a physical presence, there is an expectation that you should attend 70%, so activity monitoring is set to check everyone reaches 70% each week. Of course there will be times when you may need to do more one week and less another, however I strongly encourage you to try and keep pace with the course.
